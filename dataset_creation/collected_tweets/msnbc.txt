@SenToomey What lots of different recent polls have all been showing is that Americans of all political stripes are interested in actually getting to the factual basis of what happened and getting to the truth. Watch:,1
“One notable moment in the audio that appears to be of Trump at a dinner with Lev Parnas and others is that the voice that sounds like Trump's asks about the extent of Ukraine's reliance on aid from the U.S. in its war with Russia.” Watch @maddow,1
"Well the book provides rich detail of what we have seen everyday for the last 3 years: That Donald Trump is the most ignorant as well as incompetent individual who has ever held the office of the presidency. I worked for 6 presidents.",1
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS This is a conversation with a man Trump said he never met. Regardless, Lev Parnas is not a US government employee. He has no authority to fire anyone. What then does Trump mean when he tells Lev to "Take her out"?,1
