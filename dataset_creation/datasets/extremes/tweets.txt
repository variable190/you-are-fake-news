This is one of many reasons why the misconduct and dishonesty of Federal prosecutors working to send Omar Ameen to get tortured and executed is despicable. 
Problem with all these arguments from the legal academy (aside from ignoring the plain text of the Constitutio ) is they ignore these issues were debated in a Senate #Impeachment trial close to our founding in 1805. If not indictable, not impeachable. 
For you fucking rape skeptics, this answers the question: "why didn't she come forward when it happened" 
As Blackburn attacks Vindman, let’s remember: the diplomats who testified not only put their careers in jeopardy but also racked up six-figure legal bills They didn’t hide behind executive privilege or save their testimony for a book That’s patriotism
