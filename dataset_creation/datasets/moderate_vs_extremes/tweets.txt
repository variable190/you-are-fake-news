Well, what did you expect? But what the Republicans fail to realize is that Trump may be the REASON for the trial, but it is the Republicans that ARE actually on trial. Rep. Nadler: McConnell, GOP are covering up for the president 
“Like Kevin McCarthy in 2015, Joni Ernst said the quiet part loud yesterday, suggesting Team Trump’s attacks against Biden were less about presenting a legal defense during an impeachment trial, and more about influencing the outcome of an election.” 
“Today, I’m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before.” Even allowing for Trump’s tendency to exaggerate, this is a ridiculous claim.

That is an understatement. Out classed and out smarted by better, smarter lawyers. Mr. Shiff is second to none. 
“Nobody is telling you how to mourn or that you can’t feel sorry for the fact that he died or that it was a tragedy, because it is. But that should not therefore dictate the way others choose to remember him or what we want to say about his death.”
