What I'm struck by most from the Lev Parnas audio is that while Trump maintains he doesn't know Parnas, he's apparently captured on tape ordering the dismissal of a U.S. ambassador based on Parnas' ask, even though neither can remember her name.

Even Fox News' Chris Wallace conceded on the air, "I don't know why you wouldn't take the time and every second you have to make an argument on behalf of the president. If I were the president watching this, I would not be especially pleased."

"When you look at the Bidens &amp; the Biden family, when somebody w actually, not a job, who just was thrown out of the Navy, had nothing, all of a sudden the father becomes VP..the son is making millions &amp; millions of dollars. It’s corruption" 
This is all rambly and disjointed and took way longer than 10 minutes (which is why i need to stay off here). If you're so inclined, go listen to our @NPRCodeSwitch ep, and read @huahsu's essay on David and Shinhee's book, if you get a moment. Be easy.
